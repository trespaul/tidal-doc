As mentioned in the [Introduction](/introduction/what-is-tidal), TidalCycles consists of a stack of components.
Specifically, the stack contains, from the bottom up:

<Steps>
1. [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), the backend audio server that makes the sound, with the additional [SC3 plugins](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins);
2. [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt), the sample library and synth engine used by Tidal, installed in SuperCollider;
3. the Tidal pattern engine (TidalCycles itself), which runs on [the Haskell Language](https://www.haskell.org/) (usually installed with [ghcup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/)), and which can be installed through [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/), Haskell's package manager;
4. and a code editor such as [Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/), which talks to Tidal via a [plugin](https://github.com/tidalcycles/pulsar-tidalcycles).
</Steps>

On this page you will find guides for building up this stack for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
This can possibly be done automatically, so use whichever method suits your situation best.
Don't be afraid to reach out for help via the community if you get stuck!

:::tip
It's highly recommended to use a _limiter_ at the end of audio chains. For that, check out the [safety guide](/guides/audio/safety) after finishing with this installation!

## Install the components

### Automatic installation

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Linux">

  On Linux, you can use the [Ansible playbook by Bernard Gray](https://github.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles).
  For more information, see the linked repository, as well as the [Tidal Club thread](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/install-manage-upgrades-to-tidal-environment-with-a-single-command-on-ubuntu-debian-linux-mint-ansible-method/544).

  There is also a [Nix flake by @mitchmindtree](https://github.com/mitchmindtree/tidalcycles.nix) that you can use.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">

  For macOS there is an installation script, [tidal-bootstrap](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-bootstrap).
  This method is recommended if you are new to Tidal and don't already have SuperCollider and SuperDirt.
  If you have these or if you are well versed in managing command line installations, then use the manual installation steps below.

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

  Using the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and will install everything you need, including required dependencies.
  The installer assumes that these aren't installed already. If you do have some components (SuperCollider, SuperDirt, etc) it is recommended to use Manual installation steps for the remaining components.

  After installing Chocolatey, you can run the following command to install the [TidalCycles](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/TidalCycles) package ([source](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-chocolatey/)):

  ```bash
  choco install tidalcycles
  ```

  :::note
  The full install will take time (30+ minutes). It is best to let it run to the end, but if it exits without completion or if you need to abort, you can try running this command again. Choco will skip over any package dependencies that are already complete.

### Manual installation

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Linux">

Most modern distros will have all or most of the components of a Tidal installation available via their respective package managers.

<Steps>

0. Preparation

   First, make sure your user is a a member of the `audio` group:

   ```bash
   sudo usermod -a -G audio $USER
   ```
    
   Logout and log back in for it to take effect. You can check if it worked with:

   ```bash
   groups | grep audio
   ```

   Next, install the necessary dependencies.

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Debian">
       ```bash
       sudo apt update && sudo apt install \
         git jackd2 qjackctl zlib1g-dev gcc g++ ghc cabal-install
       ```
     </TabItem>
 
     <TabItem label="Arch">
       ```bash
       sudo pacman -Syu && sudo pacman -Sy git jack2 qjackctl
       sudo pacman -R lib32-mesa-demos mesa-demos # remove conflicts
       ```
     </TabItem>
 
     <TabItem label="Fedora">
       ```bash
       sudo dnf install git-core qjackctl gcc-c++ cabal-install
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

    
1. Install SuperCollider and the SC3-Plugins
   
   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Debian">
       ```bash
         sudo apt install supercollider sc3-{plugins,plugins-language,plugins-server}
       ```
     </TabItem>
   
     <TabItem label="Arch">
       ```bash
         sudo pacman -Sy supercollider sc3-plugins
       ```
     </TabItem>
   
     <TabItem label="Fedora">
       ```bash
         sudo dnf install supercollider
         # sc3-plugins for Fedora is provided by a 3rd party repo
         sudo dnf copr enable ycollet/audinux
         sudo dnf install supercollider-sc3-plugins
         sudo dnf copr disable ycollet/audinux # (you may choose to leave it enabled)
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. SuperDirt Installation

   SuperDirt is a plugin or "Quark" for SuperCollider, and functions as the audio engine for TidalCycles. It also provides the default set of samples.
       
   Get the version number of the latest SuperDirt release by checking the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/releases) or by running
   
   ```bash
   git ls-remote https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt.git | grep tags | tail -n1 | awk -F/ '{print $NF}'
   ```
   
   Install SuperDirt by starting the SuperCollider shell with the `sclang` command, then running the following (update the version number if required):
   
   ```c
   Quarks.checkForUpdates({Quarks.install("SuperDirt", "v1.7.3"); thisProcess.recompile()})
   ```
   
   The command returns immediately but processes in the background. Wait for it to finish and, once completed, press `Ctrl+d` to exit `sclang`.

3. Tidal Installation

   <Tabs>
     <TabItem label="Debian & Fedora">
       ```bash
         cabal update && cabal install tidal --lib
       ```
     </TabItem>
   
     <TabItem label="Arch">
       ```bash
         sudo pacman -Sy ghc ghc-libs haskell-{tidal,bifunctors,colour,hosc,mwc-random,network,primitive,random,vector,microspec}
       ```
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   
4. Almost done! The final installation step is to choose and install a [text editor (see below)](#get-a-text-editor) to interact with TidalCycles.

</Steps>
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="macOS">
<Steps>

1. Install [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) and the [SC3-plugins](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/).

2. SuperDirt

   Start your freshly installed version of SuperCollider and paste the following line of code in the text editor. Press `Cmd+Return` to evaluate it.

   ```c
   Quarks.checkForUpdates({Quarks.install("SuperDirt", "v1.7.3"); thisProcess.recompile()})
   ```

   It'll take a while to install. You will know when the installation process is done by looking at the logs window. You'll see something like the following:

   ```
   Installing SuperDirt
   Installing Vowel
   Vowel installed
   Installing Dirt-Samples
   Dirt-Samples installed
   SuperDirt installed
   compiling class library...

   ...

   <!--T:31-->
   *** Welcome to SuperCollider 3.11.2. *** For help press Ctrl-D.
   ```

3. Tidal

   Install Haskell via `ghcup`.

   Then, in a terminal window, we will add the path to our GHC installation to a file that is executed by our terminal every time it loads.
   
   For macOS10.15 Catalina, the terminal uses `zsh`, so the file we need to modify is `.zshrc`:
   
   ```bash
   . "$HOME/.ghcup/env"
   echo '. $HOME/.ghcup/env' >> "$HOME/.zshrc"
   ```
   
   For macOS 10.14 or before, the terminal uses `bash`, so the file we need to modify is `.bashrc`.
   Replace `.zshrc` in the above command with `.bashrc`.
   
   After this, we will use `cabal` to install the TidalCycles library.
   We will also run these two commands every time we want to update our TidalCycles library to the latest version.
   
   ```bash
   cabal update
   cabal v1-install tidal
   ```
   
   If you've never installed TidalCycles before, then the `cabal v1-install tidal` step may take some time.
   At the end of the command output, it should say `Installed tidal-x.x.x` (where `x.x.x` is the latest version number) without any errors.

4. Almost done! The final installation step is to choose and install a [text editor (see below)](#get-a-text-editor) to interact with TidalCycles.

</Steps>
</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Windows">

<Steps>

1. SuperCollider

   See [SuperCollider Downloads](https://supercollider.github.io/downloads),
   the [SuperCollider README](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider),
   and the [Windows README](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/blob/develop/README_WINDOWS.md).

   The [SC3 Plugins](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/) are also needed if you want to use any of the synthesisers included with TidalCycles.
   Follow the linked instructions to install them.

2. SuperDirt

   To install SuperDirt, open SuperCollider and run the following command in the interactive editor (press Ctrl+Return to evaluate):

   ```c
   Quarks.checkForUpdates({Quarks.install("SuperDirt", "v1.7.3"); thisProcess.recompile()})
   ```

   The installation will take a little while. You will know when the installation process is done by looking at the logs window. It will likely print something like the following:

   ```
   Installing SuperDirt
   Installing Vowel
   Vowel installed
   Installing Dirt-Samples
   Dirt-Samples installed
   SuperDirt installed
   compiling class library...

   ...

   *** Welcome to SuperCollider 3.12.1. *** For help press Ctrl-D.
   ```

3. Haskell and Tidal

   Install `ghcup` â€” see [Haskell `ghcup`](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) for info.
   For assistance, see the [Windows ghcup install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB4fmQiUYPw) YouTube video.

   Run this command in Windows PowerShell (as admin):

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/sh/bootstrap-haskell.ps1 -UseBasicParsing))) -ArgumentList $true } catch { Write-Error $_ }
   ```

   This should install GHCi v9.25. But Tidal 1.9.3+ is best with GHC 9.6.1 and `cabal` 3.10.1.0.
   Run these commands from PowerShell (as admin) to get the correct GHC and `cabal` versions:

   ```powershell
   ghcup install ghc 9.6.1
   ghcup install cabal 3.10.1.0
   ghcup set ghc 9.6.1
   ghcup set cabal 3.10.1.0
   ```

   To verify that the above commands worked, run

   ```powershell
   ghci --version  
   cabal --version
   ```

   TidalCycles: In PowerShell, run the following commands:

   ```powershell
   cabalÂ update
   cabalÂ v1-installÂ tidal
   ```

   Make sure to use `v1-install`, as `v2-install tidal` may not work.

4. Almost done! The final installation step is to choose and install a [text editor (see below)](#get-a-text-editor) to interact with TidalCycles.

</Steps>
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Get a text editor

To use Tidal, code needs to be run in the Tidal interface, which is a REPL (like a command line).
It's inconvenient and impractical to type and run commands directly in the REPL, so we use a text editor of our choice together with a plugin or extension to run the REPL.

Below are short introductions to the most popular text editors used with Tidal (and for code in general), and how to set them up. If you are new to code editing, choose between [Pulsar](#pulsar) and [VS Code](#vs-code).

### Pulsar

![A screenshot of the Pulsar editor.](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/raw/master/resources/readme.png)

[Pulsar](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) is a code editor that is open-source and community-led.
It is based on Atom and was started after the announcement that Atom will be [sunset](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/).
Pulsar has a Package Manager which provides for community contributions, including our TidalCycles package.

:::caution
Known issues
- macOS performance issues may be resolved by disabling the `github` package
- Auto-complete with default settings can be slower and more intrusive for livecoding. Possble workarounds include increasing "Delay Before Suggestions are Shown" to 100 or 1000 in the `autocomplete-plus package`, or disabling the package entirely.
:::

See the [`#pulsar` channel on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/779427371270275082/1047429699346903132) for support and discussion.

### VS Code

![A screenshot of the VS Code editor.](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/home/home-screenshot-linux-lg.png)

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is currently the most popular general purpose code editor. It is published by Microsoft, with some open-source components.
TidalCycles code can be written in VS Code through the [TidalCycles Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tidalcycles.vscode-tidalcycles).
Also see the [extension repository on GitHub](https://github.com/kindohm/vscode-tidalcycles) if you want to report an issue or contribute to its development.

The VS Code TidalCycles extension features an audio file browser.
After installation, click on the TidalCycles logo in the left pane to see all the samples currently available for Tidal.
From there you can preview them, and insert them directly in your code.

### Vim / Neovim

![A screenshot of a customised neovim installation.](https://neovim.io/images/showcase/goneovim.png)

[Vim](https://www.vim.org) is the [classic and ubiquitous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)) text editor.
This editor is famous for its minimalistic approach, flexibility, and for its unique approach to [modal editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi#Interface).
Vim and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), a version with new and updated features, are free, cross-platform, and open-source.
They can be extended through the help of plugins, and are generally more configurable than other text editors.
Vim has a very long history and has the reputation of being very stable and fast.
It does, however, have a steep learning curve, and is mostly used by experienced users, but fluency allows the user to edit text very fast.

[Vim-Tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vim-tidal) is the recommended plugin to interact with TidalCycles.
It will work for both [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), and will adapt to your setup.
You can use Neovim's native `terminal` functionality, as well as `tmux` or other multiplexers.
Check the [README](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vim-tidal#readme) file for more information about the installation process.

Other Vim plugins can add functionality that could be useful for livecoding.
For example â€” as suggested by `@guiot` on the [Tidal Club Forum](https://club.tidalcycles.org) â€” you can keep track of your improvisations using the [undotree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree).
Using the undotree wisely is a great way to backtrack in time or to keep a `plaintext` trace of your improvisations.
By default, `undotree` will record every little tiny changes in your text file.
Activate the `undotree` for a file by entering the `:UndotreeToggle` command.

### Emacs

![A screenshot of the a Doom Emacs setup.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/doomemacs/doomemacs/screenshots/main.png)

Emacs is, like Vim, a classic programmer's editor with a long history.
Emacs is much more than just a text editor, but it (also) has the reputation of being a little difficult to use at first.
For a while, Emacs was the only editor that worked with Tidal!  

Emacs has packages for both [Tidal](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/main/tidal.el) and [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/scel).
Learning Emacs can be intimidating at first, but it is also a very rewarding experience.
Emacs is actually a whole computing environment, and you can do pretty much everything you can imagine with this software (including sending emails and reading books).
The heart of Emacs is customization: there is a fully-fledged programming language (Emacs-Lisp) to do so.

Depending on your OS, you might have to install it in very different ways.
Check what is the recommended distribution for your system.
Once installed, be sure to check out one of the most popular configuration frameworks if you want to make things easier:
- [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)
- [Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs)

The `tidal.el` file can be found here: [tidal.el](https://raw.github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/master/tidal.el).

To install the Emacs interface to Tidal, youâ€™ll need to edit the configuration file in your home folder called `.emacs`.
If it doesnâ€™t exist, create it. Then, add the following, replacing `\~/projects/tidal` with the location of the `tidal.el` file:

```lisp
(add-to-listÂ 'load-pathÂ "~/projects/tidal")
(requireÂ 'haskell-mode)
(requireÂ 'tidal)
```

If you are using the Spacemacs custom distribution for Emacs, you should be able to use a layer made for it by `rbino`.
If you are using the develop branch, you just need to add `tidalcycles` to `dotspacemacs-configuration-layers`, and it should work out of the box.
Reload the configuration with `SPC f e R` or restart Spacemacs for the changes to take effect. 
The Tidal mode will load automatically whenever you open a `.tidal` file. Press `Ctrl/Cmd+Return` to evaluate a line. Explore the other shortcuts or map them to your liking.

If you are using Doom Emacs, edit your `packages.el` file (enter `space f p` and select `packages.el`) and add `(package! tidal)` in a new line.
In your terminal, go to `~/.emacs.d/bin` and run `./doom sync`.
Wait until the update process is done and relaunch Doom Emacs.
Edit your `BootTidal.hs` path by typing `space f p`, and selecting `config.el`.
Anywhere in this file, enter the following line:

```lisp
(setq tidal-boot-script-path "~/.cabal/share/x86_64-osx-ghc-8.8.4/tidal-1.7.4/BootTidal.hs")
```

You can now open any `.tidal` file you want.
If the highlighting is not showing up, run `tidal-mode`.
Launch Haskell with `C-c C-s`, and eval regions with `C-c C-e`.

A MELPA package is also provided for TidalCycles integration within Emacs.
You must first make sure you have MELPA installed on your machine ([instructions](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started);
basically modifying your `init.el` or `.emacs` files with the first code snippet and then executing `M-x package-refresh-contents` in Emacs.
Simply run `M-x package-install`, followed by `tidal`.
This extension provides a major mode for `*.tidal` files.
Once the package is installed, you can just open a Tidal script and press `C-c C-s` to start Tidal in Emacs, then `C-return` to run the statement under your cursor.

#### Test Tidal with Emacs

You should now have installed the Tidal Mode for Emacs. Open a new file, and give it a random name like `helloworld.tidal`. Once the file is opened, you still have to start Tidal. Enter `Ctrl-C` and then `Ctrl-S` to start. Check if Emacs and Tidal are working correctly by entering the following line and by pressing `Ctrl+Enter` to evaluate the single-line block:

```haskell
d1Â $Â brakÂ $Â soundÂ "bdÂ sn/2"
```

:::tip
`Ctrl+Enter`: evaluate a single line.

`Ctrl+C Ctrl+E`: evaluate multiple lines.

For more shortcuts, look inside the `tidal.el` file.
:::

:::note
Advanced Users: please notice that the location of the `BootTidal.hs` file is defined in the `tidal.el` file to be:
```shell
ghc-pkgÂ describeÂ $(ghc-pkgÂ latestÂ tidal)Â |Â grepÂ data-dirÂ |Â cutÂ -f2Â -dÂ 'Â '
```
You might need to override this, e.g. with the following setting (replace the path with the actual location of the BootTidal.hs file).
```lisp
(setqÂ tidal-boot-script-pathÂ "~/.cabal/share/x86_64-linux-ghc-8.6.5/tidal-1.4.8/BootTidal.hs")
```
You only need to actually change this file if you want to tweak the
`superdirtTarget`, e. g. to use SuperCollider on a remote host.
:::

### Helix

![A screenshot of the Helix editor.](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/raw/master/screenshot.png)

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com) is a code editor â€” written in Rust â€” with a fast-growing community.
It takes inspiration from other modal editors like Vim, but aims to be vastly simplified while just as capable.
Helix also aims to have things "just work", and features such as LSPs work out of the box.
It does not, however, have a plugin system yet.

To send text from Helix to Tidal, you can use Helix's "pipe to command" feature to pipe the text to a command which sends the text on to the Tidal REPL.
This can be done by using, for example, [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) or the [`kitty`](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) terminal emulator.
See [this post by `@trespaul` on the Tidal Club forum](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/language-server-protocol/1525/12) for more details.

### Sublime Text

![A screenshot of Sublime Text.](https://www.sublimetext.com/screenshots/sublime_text_4.png)

[Sublime Text](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/language-server-protocol/1525/12) is a popular cross-platform text editor.
It is closed source and costs $70 USD. You can still use Sublime Text without buying it but be ready to deal with an ominous pop-up window that remind you to buy it every few minutes.
Sublime Text is very lightweight and highly configurable.

To do live coding in Sublime Text, you need to install the *Sublime REPL* package via *Package Control*.
To avoid fiddling with the existing *Haskell REPL* supplied by *Sublime REPL*, clone this modified version of it into the *Sublime REPL* config folder (which is found in e.g., `~/Library/ApplicationÂ Support/SublimeÂ TextÂ 3/Packages/SublimeREPL/config`):

```bash
gitÂ cloneÂ https://gist.github.com/lvm/e0943b0d42507af60eee174ed263addeÂ Tidal
```
:::caution
The boot up code used by the *Sublime REPL* is currently broken.
A simple fix is to copy and paste the code from [this link](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/main/BootTidal.hs)
into `config/Tidal/ghci-tidal.conf`, replacing whatever was already there.
:::


## Other installation operations

### Upgrading

TidalCycles is a composite software. To upgrade it, it is *highly* recommended to upgrade everything along with the pattern library (the text editor and the SuperDirt audio engine as well). Each time a new version of Tidal is released, a new version of SuperDirt will likely follow, etc...

#### Ghc

If you are using windows, you will need at least version 9.4.2 of ghc installed, e.g. [via chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/ghc). 

For linux and mac, you don't need to upgrade ghc.

#### Library 

Upgrade tidal with the following from a terminal window (Linux/MacOS/Windows):

``` shell
cabal update
cabal v1-install tidal
```

If you originally installed tidal with 'cabal install' rather than 'cabal v1-install', you might have to run the following command instead. However this tends to be less reliable than the above method.
```shell
cabal update
cabal install tidal --lib
```

If things get messed up, under linux and macos you can remove the folders `.ghc` and `.cabal` from your home folder, and try again. Under windows, you can try the same but by deleting the `c:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\cabal` where `<user>` is your username.

#### Editor plugin

Your text editor might refer to the TidalCycles plugin as an *extension* or as a *package*. Check the sidebar to get more information about ways to update your favorite text editor. 

#### SuperDirt

To upgrade the SuperDirt sound synthesiser/sampler, open SuperCollider,
and paste the following command in the interactive editor. Select the text and press Shift+Enter:

``` c
Quarks.update("SuperDirt")
```

You'll need to recompile the class library. You can do this either by simply restarting the software or via the *Recompile class library* entry on the *Language* top-bar menu.


### Downgrading

Sometimes, you might want to return to an earlier version of Tidal. Use the `ghc-pkg` command to do so. Enter the following commands in your terminal (or Powershell for Windows users) to downgrade your Tidal installation.


#### Listing all the currently installed versions

This command will list the versions of Tidal you have installed. If there is more than one, the most recent will be used: 

```bash
ghc-pkg list tidal
```

#### Uninstalling a version 

To uninstall a version, you can do, for example:

```bash
ghc-pkg unregister tidal-1.0.6
```

Do this for each version until the most recent is the one you want.

#### Choosing a specific version

If you don't have the one you want installed, you can select the desired version:

```bash
cabal install tidal-0.9.10
```


### Uninstallation

TidalCycles does not provide an easy uninstaller. To uninstall Tidal, you will need to:
* Uninstall SuperDirt and/or SuperCollider if you are not already using it for another purpose.
* Uninstall the Tidal library and the GHC compiler.

<Tabs>

<TabItem label="Linux">

Uninstalling TidalCycles on Linux can be tricky. There are multiple ways of installing it depending on the distribution you are using. Here are some tips you can use to locate all the components that are part of the Tidal install.

##### Using whereis

Type `whereis scide sclang scsynth` in a terminal path to get the path to SuperCollider binaries.

##### SuperDirt Quark

Open SuperCollider. In the `File` menu, click on `Open user support directory`. This menu will take you where SuperDirt is currently installed on your computer. Check in the `downloaded-quarks` for SuperDirt. Don't forget to uninstall the `Dirt-Samples` folder as well. It can be quite heavy (all the samples are located here).

##### Uninstall stack

If you installed Tidal using Stack, you can use a dirty but simple solution to uninstall it. Run `rm -rf $HOME/.stack`. This command will delete the hidden stack folder located in your root directory.


Stack will sometimes install a binary located here: `$HOME/.local/bin`. Delete it if you want.

:::caution
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.
:::

##### Clean up cabal and GHC

To clean up `cabal` and `GHC` (user-installed packages), try running the following command in a terminal window:
```bash
rm ~/.cabal ~/.ghc
```

:::caution
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.

3. Removing individual components


##### Background

Chocolatey is package management system that is used for the Tidal Cycles automated install process. It covers the complete install of all components and dependencies needed to run Tidal. It is a good solution and works without issue much of the time. But there can also be problems and there may be a need to remove components or the whole Chocolatey environment from your computer. **This section is only a guide. Not all problems are covered.**

:::note

All steps in Powershell need to be done running Powershell as administrator.
You can run this command to see what components and versions are currently installed by choco:

```powershell
choco list --local-only
```

:::

##### Steps for Haskell Cleanup

If you have an older install from chocolatey, there will be older versions of Haskell components that can cause conflicts after the new Haskell components are installed. In this scenario, you need to uninstall any Haskell files before running the Chocolatey Tidal installer. Note that in some cases, a full uninstall of all Chocolatey may still be needed or desired.

Uninstall Haskell components
```powershell
choco uninstall ghc
choco uninstall cabal
```

Remove local packages - delete these directories:
```
C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Roaming\ghc
C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Roaming\cabal
C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Local\ghc
C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Local\cabal
```

Remove any leftover ghc / cabal directories:
```
C:\tools\ghc-<version>  for example: - C:\tools\ghc-8.10.0
C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\cabal.exe
```

##### Tidal install options  

After you cleanup Haskell, you have two options:

Run the full automated installer again.
```powershell
choco install tidalcycles
```

or

Install just Haskell via chocolatey and manually install Tidal
```powershell
choco install ghc
cabal update
cabal v1-install tidal
```

##### Steps for full wipe of Chocolatey

This will remove everything installed by Chocolatey, then remove the choco installer itself. It cleans up environment variables and directories. Note: this will remove everything in the Tidal stack: SuperCollider/SuperDirt, Pulsar, Haskell, etc. This is recommended if:

- you want to switch to manual install
- you have significant install problems and want to "start fresh"

**Steps**

<Steps>
1. Uninstall chocolatey installed components

   ```powershell
   choco uninstall all -x -y
   ```

2. Remove applications - delete these directories

   ```
   C:\tools
   C:\ProgramData\chocolatey
   ```

3. Remove local packages - delete these directories:
   ```
   C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Roaming\ghc
   C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Roaming\cabal
   C:\Users\yourUser\AppData\Local\ghc
   C:\Users\yourUser \AppData\Local\cabal
   ```

4. Environment variables
   - User variables:
     - delete: ChocolateyLastPathUpdate, ChocolateyToolsLocation
     - from Path, remove: C:\tools\ghc-yourVersionNumber\bin
   - System variables:
     - delete variables: ChocolateyInstall
     - from Path, remove: C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin

5. Reboot system
</Steps>

Now you can proceed with the Manual install steps, or start over from scratch with the Automated installer steps.

Good luck!

:::info

Sometimes the Tidal install process can be complicated and take many steps. Stick with it! The good news is that once it is working, the Tidal stack is very stable and reliable.

##### Using uninstall-hs

Open a terminal window and type `uninstall-hs`. This command will delete many things Haskell related from your computer.

##### Uninstalling ghcup

If you installed Tidal using `ghcup`, you can try a hacky solution. Open a terminal window and paste `rm -rf ~/.ghcup`. This will delete the `.ghcup` hidden directory that was living in your root directory.

:::caution
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.
:::

##### Clean up cabal and GHC

To clean up `cabal` and `GHC` (user-installed packages), try running the following command in a terminal window:
```bash
rm ~/.cabal ~/.ghc
```

:::caution
Double-check or triple-check the `rm -rf` command. This is a powerful tool that will delete things definitively. Use it with caution as it can be quite dangerous if you mess with it.
