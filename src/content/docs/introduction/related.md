Here is a list of projects connected with TidalCycles, whether they interface with, inspired, or are inspired by it.

(For a long list of *all* the live coding environments, see the [awesome-livecoding](https://github.com/toplap/awesome-livecoding) list.)

## Ports and parsers

- [Estuary](https://github.com/dktr0/estuary) is a platform for collaboration and learning through live coding, hosting a range of environments in a web-browser, including "minitidal", a parser for Tidal
- [Strudel](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) is an advanced port of TidalCycles to Javascript that runs in a web browser
- [Kidal](https://gitlab.com/ndr_brt/kidal) is a port of Tidal to Kotlin
- [Tranquility](https://github.com/XiNNiW/tranquility/) is a port of Tidal to Lua
- [Vortex](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vortex/) is a port of Tidal to Python

## Editors

- [Extramuros](https://github.com/dktr0/extramuros), a language-neutral shared-buffer networked live coding system in the browser (precursor of Estuary)
- [Feedforward](https://github.com/yaxu/feedforward), a strange terminal-based editor in development
- [Siren](https://github.com/cannc4/Siren), a tracker interface for TidalCycles and SuperCollider
- [Troop](https://github.com/qirky/troop), a real-time collaborative tool that enables group live coding within the same document across multiple computers. Works with a range of live coding languages, including Tidal

### Editor plugins

- [Emacs](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Tidal/blob/master/tidal.el)
- [Sublime text](/getting-started/installation#sublime-text)
- [vim](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/tidalcycles/vscode-tidalcycles)

## Synths and samplers

- [Dirt](https://github.com/tidalcycles/dirt), the original 'classic' dirt, implemented in C
- [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/), the SuperCollider rewrite, recommended for general use (unless running in a web browser)
- [webdirt](https://github.com/dktr0/WebDirt), the Javascript rewrite, part of estuary

## SuperCollider (or SuperDirt) add-ons

- [StageMaster](https://github.com/calumgunn/StageMaster) — light mastering chain for use during live performance in SuperCollider

## Visual systems

- [Didactic pattern visualizer](https://github.com/ivan-abreu/didacticpatternvisualizer) — Sound pattern visualizer programmed in Processing
- [p5jsDirt](https://github.com/Dsm0/p5jsDirt/) — integration with p5.js

## Syncing / interfacing

- [Carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner), for bridging with the Link protocol
- [ESPGrid](https://github.com/dktr0/espgrid), synchronisation designed for live coding environments including supercollider, foxdot as well as tidal
- [Node.js interface](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vliegwerk/tidal) for sending messages between Javascript and tidal

## Tidal-inspired systems

- [Krill](https://github.com/Mdashdotdashn/krill) — a javascript-based live coding environment inspired by tidal
- [tidal.pegjs](https://github.com/gibber-cc/tidal.pegjs) — a parsing expression grammar for the TidalCycles mini-notation, written using PEG.js. The goal of the PEG is to easily translate strings of Tidal-style mini notation into annotated JavaScript data structures for use in sequencing. Works with [Gibber](http://gibber.cc/) and [Hydra](https://hydra-editor.glitch.me/)!

## Systems that inspired Tidal

- [Bol processor](http://bolprocessor.sourceforge.net/) — algorithmic music system based on compositional grammars, grown from research into symbolic notation of tabla rhythms
- [Euterpea](http://www.euterpea.com/) is a cross-platform, domain-specific language for computer music applications embedded in the Haskell programming language
- Douglas Repetto's beat rotation experiments, e.g. rotcomposer in [MEAPsoft](http://www.meapsoft.com/showcase.php)
