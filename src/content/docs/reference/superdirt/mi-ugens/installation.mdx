## Description

[Mutable Instruments](https://mutable-instruments.net/) was a popular Eurorack module company from Normandy. The designer, engineer, and founder of Mutable Instruments, [Émilie Gillet](https://github.com/pichenettes), has made all of her work [open source](https://github.com/pichenettes/eurorack). [Volker Böhm](https://vboehm.net/) has taken the time to [port](https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens) some of these modules to [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) under the project title "mi-UGens" (no affiliation with Mutable Instruments).

Significant further work to make mi-UGens functional in Tidal was done by a large number of forum users, documented in [this thread](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/mutable-instruments-ugens/2730) by [@chrislo](https://club.tidalcycles.org/u/chrislo/summary)

## Installation

### Automatic

For debian/ubuntu/mint systems, these ugens can be installed as part of the [ansible Tidal installer](https://github.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles#ugens-mutable-instruments)

### Manual

<Steps>

1. Unpack the [latest release](https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens/releases/latest/) from [mi-UGens](https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens) appropriate to your Operating System (**Note:** Windows is missing from 0.0.4, try [0.0.3](https://github.com/v7b1/mi-UGens/releases/tag/v0.0.3) which has everything except mi-Braids)

2. Move the top level directory of the archive (`mi-UGens/`) into the SuperCollider Extensions folder (create it if it doesn't exist):

    - Linux: `/home/<youruser>/.local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/mi-UGens`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\Extensions\mi-UGens`
    - OSX: `/Users/<youruser>/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/mi-UGens`

    :::tip
    The SuperCollider Extensions folder can be found by running `Platform.userExtensionDir` in SuperCollider. The path will be printed to the post window.
    :::

3. Create a new synthdef file `mi-ugens.scd`, with [these synthdefs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles-synth-mi-ugens/master/files/mutable-instruments-synthdefs.scd)

    - Linux:   `/home/<youruser>/.local/share/SuperCollider/synthdefs/mi-ugens.scd`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\synthdefs\mi-ugens.scd`
    - OSX:     `/home/<youruser>/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/synthdefs/mi-ugens.scd`


4. Create a new parameter definitions file, `mi-ugens-params.hs`, with [these parameters](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cleary/ansible-tidalcycles-synth-mi-ugens/master/files/mutable-instruments-ugens_parameters.hs)

    - Linux:   `/home/<youruser>/.local/share/SuperCollider/synthdefs/mi-ugens-params.hs`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\synthdefs\mi-ugens-params.hs`
    - OSX:     `/Users/<youruser>/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/synthdefs/mi-ugens-params.hs`

5. Configure SuperCollider - edit your `startup.scd`:

    - Linux:   `/home/<youruser>/.conf/SuperCollider/startup.scd`
    - Windows: `C:\Users\<youruser>\AppData\Local\SuperCollider\startup.scd`
    - OSX:     `/Users/<youruser>/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/startup.scd`

6. Load the `mi-ugens.scd` synthdef in `startup.scd`. Use the full path from **3.**

    :::caution
    WINDOWS Users: You must use double backslashes for the `load()` path in startup.scd, eg `load("C:\\Users\\<youruser>\...");`
    :::

    After:
    ```c
    // ...
      ~dirt = SuperDirt(2, s);
    ```
    ```c
      // load mi-ugens.scd synthdefs
      load("FULL_PATH_TO_mi-ugens.scd");
      // end load mi-ugens.scd synthdefs
    ```

7. Configure `verb` and `clouds` as Global Effects. Add the following stanza as indicated to your `startup.scd`:

    After:
    ```c
    // ...
                ~d10 = ~dirt.orbits[9]; ~d11 = ~dirt.orbits[10]; ~d12 = ~dirt.orbits[11];
            );
    ```
    ```c          
            // define global effects for mutable instruments effects
            ~dirt.orbits.do { |x|
                var clouds = GlobalDirtEffect(\global_mi_clouds, [\cloudspitch, \cloudspos, \cloudssize, \cloudsdens, \cloudstex, \cloudswet, \cloudsgain, \cloudsspread, \cloudsrvb, \cloudsfb, \cloudsfreeze, \cloudsmode, \cloudslofi]);
                var verb = GlobalDirtEffect(\global_mi_verb, [\verbwet, \verbtime, \verbdamp, \verbhp, \verbfreeze, \verbdiff, \verbgain]);
                x.globalEffects = x.globalEffects
                  .addFirst(clouds)
                  .addFirst(verb); 
                x.initNodeTree;    
            };                     
            // end define global effects for mutable instruments effects
    ```

8. Save your `startup.scd` and exit

9. You can choose to import the `mi-ugens-params.hs` parameter definitions manually in your tidal session, or add the following `:script` directive to the `BootTidal.hs` file associated with your editor of choice (locating the correct `BootTidal.hs` is beyond the scope of this reference)

    After:
    ```haskell
    -- ...
        setR = streamSetR tidal
        setB = streamSetB tidal    
    :}
    ```
    Add:
    ```haskell 
    :script FULL_PATH_TO_mi-ugens-params.hs
    ```
    Which should now be followed by
    ```haskell
    :set prompt "tidal>"
    :set prompt-cont ""
    -- ...
    ```

10. Start/restart SuperCollider

    :::tip
    OSX Users: You may see a security dialog disallowing the ugens to run. Please see [this post by @oscd](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/mutable-instruments-ugens/2730/106) for workarounds/fixes
