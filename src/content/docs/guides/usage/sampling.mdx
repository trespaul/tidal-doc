## The default sample library

Installing SuperDirt will also download a [library](../../reference/superdirt/default-samples/) of audio samples. This library is known as the *default* library, the one that everybody starts with.

:::tip
The community is currently trying to come up with a new refined version of the default library, named ironically [Clean Samples](https://github.com/tidalcycles/Clean-Samples/). You can help by submitting your custom samples. This is an ongoing project.

## Custom samples

Adding and using your own custom samples in TidalCycles is relatively easy. You don't actually add samples, but instead add them into SuperCollider and the SuperDirt quark. To do this, you will need to customize your SuperDirt startup code.

When you open SuperCollider, instead of the normal `SuperDirt.start`
code, you will need to write a longer script that tells SuperDirt where
to find your samples. The startup script will look like this:

``` c
(
s.waitForBoot {
    ~dirt = SuperDirt(2, s); // two output channels
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/myUserName/Dirt/samples/*"); // specify sample folder to load
    s.sync; // wait for supercollider to finish booting up
    ~dirt.start(57120, 0 ! 12); // start superdirt, listening on port 57120, create twelve orbits each sending audio to channel 0
};
);
```

To run the above code, place the cursor anywhere inside that code block,
then press `Ctrl+Enter` (or `Command+Enter` on MacOS) to evaluate the
whole block.

The above code will boot the SuperCollider server, then start up
SuperDirt with some samples located at `/Users/myUserName/Dirt/samples`. You can find a more complete [startup file](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt/blob/develop/superdirt_startup.scd) in the SuperDirt code repository.

:::caution
If you are running Windows, you will need to escape the backslash characters in Windows paths:

```c
~dirt.loadSoundFiles("c:\\Users\\myUserName\\Dirt\\samples\\*")
```
:::

If you have samples located in many folders, you can import them all:

``` c
(
s.waitForBoot {
    ~dirt = SuperDirt(2, s); // two output channels

        <!--T:20-->
// load samples from multiple folders:
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/myUserName/Dirt/samples/*"); 
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/myUserName/sounds/*"); 
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/myUserName/recordings/chaska-sessions/*");
    ~dirt.loadSoundFiles("/Users/myUserName/recordings/super-duper-experiments/*"); 

    <!--T:21-->
s.sync; // wait for supercollider to finish booting up
    ~dirt.start(57120, [0, 0]); // start superdirt, listening on port 57120, create two orbits each sending audio to channel 0
};
);
```

In the above example, we have imported a folder at the path `/Users/myUserName/Dirt/samples`. In order for SuperDirt to recognize the sound names that Tidal sends, the `/Users/myUserName/Dirt/samples` folder will need to have sub-folders for each sound name, and each sound name folder will need to have sample files:

<FileTree>
- Users
  - myUserName
    - Dirt
      - samples
        - myBass
          - bass1.wav
          - bass2.wav
          - bass3.wav
        - hits
          - hit1.wav
          - hit2.wav
          - hit3.wav
        - field
          - bridge.wav
          - mountains1.wav
          - mountains2.wav
          - plains.wav
          - river.wav
</FileTree>

Given the folder structure above, you can now use the `myBass`, `hits`,
and `field` sounds in your Tidal patterns:

```haskell
d1 $ s "mybass hits*4" # n (slow 2 $ run 3)
d2 $ n "<0 2 1>" # s "field" # cut 1
```

### Lazy-loading

If you are working with large sample libraries or if you use an old computer, you can turn on *lazy loading* in SuperDirt as mentionned [here](https://club.tidalcycles.org/t/superdirt-lazy-samples-loading/3148).

Instead of loading all your audio samples in the RAM as usual, SuperDirt will load audio samples *on request*. This is better for people working with a limited amount of memory.

To enable it, update SuperDirt to the last commit (go into the downloaded-quarks/SuperDirt folder then `git pull`) then, in the SuperDirt startup code, before any `~dirt.loadSoundFiles` call, put a `~dirt.doNotReadYet = true;`.


## Pitched sample playback with `metatune`

By default, SuperDirt treats all samples as having a pitch of C4 (MIDI note 60).
Playing a sample tonally is simple as long the sound is indeed a C. But what if not?

It is possible to embed pitch metadata in WAV files in the form of a [`smpl` chunk](https://www.recordingblogs.com/wiki/sample-chunk-of-a-wave-file).
This is used by some samplers to automatically map samples to MIDI notes.
SuperDirt also reads the pitch metadata for all loaded samples, allowing them to be pitched correctly (assuming the metadata is correct) by setting the `metatune` parameter to 1.

For example, the sample `bass1:18` from Dirt-Samples is an F2 (MIDI note 41) and is tagged with the appropriate pitch metadata.
With `metatune`, we can easily play it in tune with a superpiano chord:

```haskell
d1 $ stack
  [ note "<d4 c4 a3 bf3>" # s "bass1:18" # legato 1 # metatune 1
  , note "[~ d5'min'o]*4" # s "superpiano" # release 0.4
  ] # cps 0.35
```

`smpl` chunk metadata can be edited with various tools such as [pitcheon](https://github.com/ahihi/pitcheon) or [LoopAuditioneer](https://loopauditioneer.sourceforge.io/).


## Finding samples

The *default samples library* is full of surprises. You will have a lot of fun exploring it but at some point, you might want to download new audio samples. You'll find tons of websites selling audio samples for music production, ranging from the less expensive to the most priciest thing you've ever seen. However, there are good ways to find free and high-quality audio samples for Tidal.

Here is a small list of websites for free samples you could check:

* [Freesound](https://freesound.org/): Free ... sounds.
