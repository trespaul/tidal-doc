## Purpose
The TidalCycles blog is intended to be *by — for — about* the Tidal community.
Anyone engaged with TidalCycles is encouraged to submit a blog post. Topics can be about Tidal practices, music made with Tidal, live coding, event coverage, new developments & releases, community, etc. Topics can also be broader — anything that would be of interest to this community, and it doesn't have to be limited to Tidal!

## Templates
To make submitting posts easier, there are a set if templates. Each template includes a suggested set of content sections, but consider this just a starting point. The most important thing is to provide content that reflects your unique perspective.

Templates are maintained in GitHub in the [tidalcycles/tidal-doc](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/) repo / templates branch.

- [Tidal Blog Profile](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/blob/templates/templates/blog_tidal_profile.md) Intended to highlight your livecoding practices, music, and use of tidal. It contains a set of questions to respond to.

- [Tidal music](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/blob/templates/templates/blog_tidal_music.md) Use this to describe a music project such as a new album or music release, a review of a music project, Algorave or concert, or discussion of music made with Tidal or other live coding program. Examples:
    - [Xuixo EP by Relyt R](/blog/xuixo)
    - [QBRNTHSS - making a live coding album](/blog/qbrnthss)

- [Blog Topic](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/blob/templates/templates/blog_topic.md) Open topic. Use this for a more free-form approach. One option is to present your own approach to Tidal and live coding. Other topics could be discussion of a new release and the coding behind it, or discussion of other environments like Strudel. Examples:
    - [Working with Samples the Heavy Lifting way](/blog/heavylifting)
    - [How Link became Tidal's scheduler](/blog/link-scheduler)
    - [Visualization with Didactic Pattern Visualizer](/blog/visualizer)

- [Playlist](https://github.com/tidalcycles/tidal-doc/blob/templates/templates/blog_playlist.md) Use this to create a new playlist. See the [Tidal Eclectic Playlist](/blog/playlist-eclectic).

We encourage posts to include:
- code sections with Tidal examples
- links into the Tidal user documentation
- links to recordings, YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, etc.
