### Purpose of different docs sections

1. **Introduction:** what is Tidal, what is it used for, what has it been used for, who are the community, etc.
2. **Getting started:** how to get up and running from scratch, to making a first sound.
3. **Guides:** all guides to do a specific thing that isn't necessary to know at first.
4. **Reference:** lists of, e.g., functions or options and their descriptions, perhaps with an example; could perhaps be autogenerated.

The specific pages are:

- **Introduction**
  - What is Tidal? [what it is; what it is used for; the components of the stack; the concept: cycles and patterns]
  - Showcase [select performances / releases; list of artists; academic publications; ...]
  - Community [links to platforms, forum]
  - Related projects [livecoding projects, inspired / inspired by; e.g., tidal-vis ...]
- **Getting started**
  - Installation
  - Tutorial [getting from installed to first sounds, then to sounding like something (introduce to basic usage of stuff, incl. mini-notation) (can be multiple pages)]
    - currently: cycles, patterns, controls
- **Guides** [how to do specific things that aren't necessary to know at first; address common questions like "how do I get Tidal to do X?"; page titles should follow from "How to ..." / start with a verb; can perhaps be organised into subsections, or we can rely on search; the below are examples]
  - Coding with Tidal
    - Create patterns
      - Write arpeggios
      - Write chords
